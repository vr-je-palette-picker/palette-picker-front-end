## About the App
Palette Picker is an application that allows the user to find, create, and save color palettes. The user can save to an existing folder, or choose to a create a new one. When a user is done with a palette or project, they can click the delete icons and those items will be deleted. Please note that all of your palettes will be lost if that project is deleted. Have fun!

  #### Process
  We worked as a team, pairing and collaborating often. We began our process by wireframing and then built our backend in Node.js. While programming the backend, we set up continuous integration and deployed to heroku. After building the backend we revised our wireframe and dove into building out the front end in React. Finally, we deployed our frontend to heroku, making our application fully usable on a live site.
