## About the App
Palette Picker is an application that allows the user to find, create, and save color palettes. The user can save to an existing folder, or choose to a create a new one. When a user is done with a palette or project, they can click the delete icons and those items will be deleted. Please note that all of your palettes will be lost if that project is deleted. Have fun!
